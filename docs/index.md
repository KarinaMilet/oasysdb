# Introducing OasysDB

![OasysDB Use Case](https://i.postimg.cc/k4x4Q55k/banner.png)

OasysDB is a flexible and easy to use vector database for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors. OasysDB is built with Rust and uses the HNSW algorithm for vector indexing.

The goal of OasysDB is to provide a vector database with great developer experience throughout the lifecycle of the project; from early development to production. In addition to a simple and easy-to-use API, OasysDB can be used in 3 different ways:
