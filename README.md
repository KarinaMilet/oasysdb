I am currently exploring Vector DB concepts and needed a prototype to experiment with some ideas. Instead of building from scratch and finding solutions like Lance or Qdrant which are too complex, I discovered oasysdb. I believe itâ€™s a great fit as a prototype for testing my concepts.

Special thanks to the original author of oasysdb for providing such a concise and efficient implementation.
