## Notice

This repository is not currently maintained. I initially created this project to
learn more about databases and Rust. As times goes on, I actually learned from
this project and the people who used it. Unfortunately, most open-source
projects doesn't generate enough revenue to sustain itself.

I'm currently looking for a new opportunity to work as a **Software Engineer in
AI Infrastructure**. If you have or know someone who has an open position,
please let me know. I'm open to work remotely or anywhere in the United States.

You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinkys).

If you're interested in taking over this project, please let me know. I'll be
happy to discuss the details with you. Other than that, I'll just leave this
project as is for historical purposes.

Thank you all for your support and understanding. It's been a great journey!
